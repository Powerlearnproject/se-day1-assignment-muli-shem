#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
Security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering: Formalized the term "software engineering."

The rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the 1980s: Enhanced modularity and reusability (Booch, 1991).

Agile Manifesto (2001): Revolutionized software development with iterative, collaborative processes (Beck et al., 2001).


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis: Gathering and defining user needs.

Design: Creating system architecture and software design.

Implementation: Writing and compiling code.

Testing: Verifying functionality and identifying defects.

Deployment: Releasing the software to users.

Maintenance: Updating and improving the software post-release.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: Linear, sequential process; ideal for projects with clear, stable requirements (e.g., medical devices).

Agile: Iterative, flexible process; suitable for dynamic projects with evolving requirements (e.g., web apps).


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes, tests, and debugs code.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Designs and executes test cases to ensure quality.

Project Manager: Oversees project timelines, resources, and team coordination.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, PyCharm): Streamline coding with features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and autocompletion.

VCS (e.g., Git, SVN): Tracks changes, facilitates collaboration, and prevents data loss.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
